# Hospital-Management-System
Hospitals enhance the effectiveness of many other areas of the health-care system by providing continuous access to services for acute and complex diseases. They concentrate scarce resources within well-planned referral networks in order to respond quickly to population-based health demands.
This project, titled 'HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,' is a software that aids in the monitoring and control of a hospital's entire management.
The project is written in Python, and the data is stored in MySQL. The nltk library and sklearn are used to create the chatbot. This project focuses on fundamental hospital activities such as adding, searching, removing, editing, displaying data, and taking appointments, as well as a support desk (with a voice assistant) and a chatbot that may offer the user with information about Covid -19.
A covid zone, which administers covid patients, is also part of the initiative.
